# Dataset
Batik image dataset is collected by capturing 50 types of Batik cloth. Each cloth is captured to as much as six random images and then resized to 128x128 pixels size in JPEG format. Thus, the total number of images in a dataset is 300 and consists of 50 classes. In general, there are two patterns of captured batik images, geometric and non-geometric patterns.
